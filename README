This is a collection of scripts and so forth that I have found helpful for my gEDA workflow.


These tools may presuppose the following directory structure however you may be able to modify them to suit your own setup.

project-dir/
project-dir/Makefile  
project-dir/gitignore
project-dir/sch/  
procect-dir/sch/gafrc
project-dir/sch/gschemrc
project-dir/sch/gnetlistrc
project-dir/sch/subcircuits/
project-dir/sch/sym/
project-dir/pcb/
project-dir/release/
project-dir/release/img
project-dir/release/gerber

The tools also assume you are using a git repository to track your files.
